# Brain_Tumor_Classification_Using_Machine_Learning
# Abstract
Medical imaging is gaining importance with an increase in the demand for automated,
reliable, fast and efficient diagnosis which can provide insight into the image better than
human eyes. The brain tumoris the second leading cause for cancer-related deaths in
men age 20 to 39 and leading cause cancer among women in the same age group. Brain
tumors are painful and should end in various diseases if not curedproperly. The diagnosis
of the tumor is a very important part of its treatment. Identification plays an important
part in the diagnosis ofbenign and malignant tumors. A prime reason behind a rise
in thenumber of cancer patients worldwide is the ignorance towards the treatment of a
tumor in its early stages.
This paper discusses such a machine learning algorithm that can write the user about
the details of the tumor using brain MRI. These methods include noise removal and
sharpening of the image along with basic morphological functions, erosion, and dilation, to
obtain the background.Subtractions of background and its negative from different sets of 
images result in extracted in age. Plotting contour and c-label of the tumor andits
boundary provides us with information related to the tumor that can help in a better
visualization in diagnosing cases. This process helps in identifying the size, shape, and
position of the tumor. It helps the medical staff as well the patient to understand the
seriousness of the tumor with the help of different color-labeling for different levels of
elevation. A GUI for the contour of the tumor and its boundary can provide information
to the medical staff on the click of user choice buttons.
# Objective
To Detect and Classify Brain Tumor using, CNN and TL; as an asset of Deep Learning and to examine the tumor position(segmentation).
# Dataset
The dataset contians MRI data. The images are already split into Training and Testing folders. Each folder has more four subfolders. These folders have MRIs of respective tumor classes. You can download dataset by using link : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15A0TU23O94dSbP9qGP8_aqX0JWr0HGDj?usp=drive_link
# Methodology
1. Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Data Agumentation
4. Build CNN model
5. Model Training
6. Prediction and Evaluation
# Result
In brain tumor classification using machine learning, I performed image classification with help of CNN using transfer learning which gave me an accuracy of 92%.
